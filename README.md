# Enumerable Methods

Enumerable Methods is the second project, and the only solo one, in the Microverse's Ruby curriculum. It consists in create methods identical to some methods that belong to the [Enumerable](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/) mixin:

* #my_each for [each](https://apidock.com/ruby/ARGF/each)
* #my_each_with_index for [each_with_index ](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/each_with_index)
* #my_select for [select](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/select), from this point, using the #my_each method created
* #my_all for [all?](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/all%3F)
* #my_any for [any?](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/any%3F)
* #my_none for [none?](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/none%3F)
* #my_count for [count](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/count)
* #my_map for [map](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/map)
* #my_inject for [inject](https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Enumerable/inject)
* #multiply_els using the #my_inject method.
